# Ubuntu Crypto Price Ticker

Ubuntu Crypto Price Ticker is a simple price ticker widget for Linux Ubuntu
for showing the current price of any coin.

It was written on Ubuntu 17.10 and is a personal project of mine so
compatibility with other versions of Ubuntu may or may not work.

## Installation
Install python dependencies by running the following command:
```
 make install
```
## Configuration
Configuration of tokens can be done by copying the `tokens-example.yaml` file
over to your own `tokens.yaml` file.

## Running
* Simply run `make` or `python3 app/main.py` to start the app

## Token Images
Token images are auto-downloaded from the coinmarketcap.com website each time
a new coin is added to the tokens.yaml file and doesn't already exist in the
repository. If you could be so kind as to push these up to the repo that would
be great and would serve others well.

**Tweaks:**

* I have changed the decimal precison to none. If you want to include, remove `int` conversion in `self.widget.set_label` in `app/widgets.py` and change precison from 0 to (for example, back to) 2.
* You can add other configuration in example.yaml file by adding more commas. Be sure to use the fields in `__init__` in `app/widgets.py` after conf has been split. 
* Renamed `tokens-example.yaml` to `tokens.yaml` by default. Removed `tokens.yaml` from `.gitignore` as well due to added inline guide. Consider adding it again if you are pushing changes not related to it. 
* Do contact me for any more suggestion or additions. I'll be happy to add those. I'm grateful to peter-featherstone for this awesome widget.  

**Improved Guide for defining Tokens in tokens.yaml:**

* You can find brief guide to help yourself adding new tokens in tokens.yaml.
* You need to define Token ID in the file as CMC API doesn't support symbols yet. 
* Token ids are generally same as coin name in lowercase. Replace space by hyphen in multiword token names. For example, `basic-attention-token` for Basic Attention Token (BAT)
* Find exact ids on CMC's token page url. For example, `coinmarketcap.com/currencies/basic-attention-token/`
* You can change refresh time in seconds by changing `REFRESH_TIME_IN_SECONDS` variable in `app/widget.py` file. Default is 10 mins so you may want to consider changing it. 


**Support for other conversion currencies including Satoshis:**

* I have added support for defining crypto-currencies and fiat as conversion currencies.
* Satoshi is also supported. Use 'SAT' for the same. For example, `bgogo-token,SAT`. 1 BTC equals 100 million Satoshis.
* You can define conversion currency as `<coin-id>,<conversion currency>`. For example, `Ethereum,INR` will show Ethereum price in Indian Rupees. 
* Both crypto-currency and fiat are supported for conversion as per CMC data. For example, you can use `Ripple,EUR` as well as `Ripple,BTC`.
* I have added a local array `currency_symbol` in `app/widget.py` file that countains symbol for different currencies (including crypto). Consider contributing into it or suggest me a suitable python library. I have used `ã‚·` symbol for Satoshi. You change it to whatever you like.
