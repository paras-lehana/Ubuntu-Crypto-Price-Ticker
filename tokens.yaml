# Define your token ids here.
# Token ids are generally same as coin name.
# Replace space by hyphen in multiword token names. For example, basic-attention-token
# Find exact ids on CMC's token page url. For example, coinmarketcap.com/currencies/basic-attention-token/

# As per fork by paras-lehana:
  
  # You can define conversion currency as <coin-id>,<conversion currency>.
  # For example, 'Ethereum,INR' will show Ethereum price in Indian Rupees. 
  # Both crypto-currency and fiat are supported for conversion as per CMC data.
  # Satoshis is also supported. Use 'SAT' for the same.
