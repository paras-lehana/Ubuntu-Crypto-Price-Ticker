# Define your token ids here.
# Token ids are generally same as coin name.
# Replace space by hyphen in multiword token names. For example, basic-attention-token
# Find exact ids on CMC's token page url. For example, coinmarketcap.com/currencies/basic-attention-token/

# As per fork by paras-lehana:
  
  # You can define conversion currency and precision as <coin-id>,<conversion currency>,<precision>.
  # Coversion: For example, 'Ethereum,INR' will show Ethereum price in Indian Rupees.  
  # Default conversion is 'USD'
  # Both crypto-currency and fiat are supported for conversion as per CMC data.
  # Satoshis is also supported. Use 'SAT' for the same.  
  # Precision: For example, 'Ethereum,USD,0' will show Ethereum price in US Dollars with 0 decimal places. So, a price of $172.11 will round off to $172
  # Default precision is 2 (two decimal places). 
  # Make sure to put precision after 2 commas. 'Bitcoin,,0' is also supported where conversion will be assumed default (USD).
